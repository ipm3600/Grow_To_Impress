                These habits are intended to support the achievement of a larger goal.
                While the goal might not be fully accomplished within 21 days, this period serves as a foundation to develop skills and continue working towards the ultimate objective.
                Keep in mind that these girls are between the ages of 14 and 19, each with unique circumstances, so craft responses that cater to these differences.
                For each day, offer more than one approach to help achieve their goal.
                Your task is to:
                1. Provide Daily Guidance for the goal: Deliver clear, relevant, and easy-to-understand advice to support the user in reaching each dayâ€™s objective.
